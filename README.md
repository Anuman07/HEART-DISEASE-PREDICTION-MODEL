# HEART DISEASE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

Problem Objective : Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
Heart disease prevention is critical, and data-driven prediction systems can significantly aid in early diagnosis and treatment. Machine Learning offers accurate prediction capabilities, enhancing healthcare outcomes. In this project, I analyzed a heart disease dataset with appropriate preprocessing. Multiple classification algorithms were implemented in Python using Scikit-learn and Keras to predict the presence of heart disease.

Algorithms Used:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine (Linear)

K-Nearest Neighbors

Decision Tree

Random Forest

XGBoost

Artificial Neural Network (1 Hidden Layer, Keras)
